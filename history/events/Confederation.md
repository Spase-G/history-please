# Confederation
## Overview
Confederation refers to the amalgamation of the Province of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick into one federal dominion known as Canada. In the same context, the term also refers to the entrance of other provinces into the union.
The negotiations of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswickwere ratified by the British parliament in the British North America Acts, 1867 (now the Constitution Act, 1867).
Over time, other provinces negotiated their entries into confederation, leading to the current 10 provinces and three federally created territories. 
## Prelude to Confederation
### Province of Canada
The Province of Canada consisted of Upper Canada (modern day Ontario) and Lower Canada (modern day Quebec). The Province of Canada had been formed primarily out of the territory that was formerly New France. 
As a result, there were political concerns amongst the English protestants in Upper Canada as to how to deal with the political influence of the French Catholics of Upper Canada in Parliament. 
The concern was that the French Catholics would create a voting bloc alongside English Catholics so that they would have control over parliament. The English Protestants saw a political union with other protistant colonies as a way to create a larger voting bloc. 
The politicians of Lower Canada had their own concerns, primarily that they wanted their own assurances in language, religion, and education. They believed that if they negotiated these assurances for their own territory, the rest of the colonies could do as they pleased. As such, Lower Canada saw the negotiations leading up to Confederation as an opportunity to entrench these protections.
